This project contains files for a Emotional Music Recommender. This was built for our Collective Intelligence final project. There are two parts to the project: general recommendations for a user and critique recommendations for a single song.

The critique recommendation file can be found in critiqueRec.py. Currently the critiqueTagMore and critiqueTagLess functions take inputs of a tag:val dictionary and the tag to be critiqued and return the top 5 similar songs in the respective directions.
